* default setup for double wishbone... will upload a default for macpherson in the future hopefully
* See Naming_Convention for double wishbone points naming convention used in this script
* code should be somewhat commented... algorithm partially stolen from wikipedia
* approach taken from Spinning Thumbs on yt


## Known bugs
